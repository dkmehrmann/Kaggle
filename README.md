# Practice
This repository is mainly for things I do for school or fun but have no obvious purpose. For example:

* [ASTR](https://github.com/dkmehrmann/Practice/tree/master/ASTR) Contains work I've done for ASTR 596 at UIUC
* [Titanic](https://github.com/dkmehrmann/Practice/tree/master/Titanic) Contains work relating to the [Titanic project on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and [this](http://trevorstephens.com/post/72916401642/titanic-getting-started-with-r) tutorial.
* [CodingBat.ipynb](https://github.com/dkmehrmann/Practice/blob/master/CodingBat.ipynb) is an iPython notebook with my solutions to some of the [CodingBat problems](http://codingbat.com/python)
