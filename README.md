# Practice

This repository is mainly for things I do for school or fun but have no obvious purpose. For example:

* ASTR 596.ipynb is a notebook I wrote for ASTR 596 at UIUC on hyperparameter optimization.
* CodingBat.ipynb is an iPython notebook with my solutions to some of the [CodingBat problems](http://codingbat.com/python) 
* elo_538.ipynb gets ELO numbers for NFL prediction from [fivethiryeight](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2015-nfl-predictions/)
* rkernel.ipynb is a short notebook that demonstrates a Jupyter Notebook running an R kernel. 
* rmagic.ipynb demonstrates the rmagic cell magic
* twitter_api_demo.ipynb demonstrates the rate limiting of the Twitter API
